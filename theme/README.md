This is a theme directory, though part of module. 
This theme is specific to screenswiki module.

Install it as a any other theme under name 'screenswiki'. 
For now, there is a hardcoded dependency in screenswiki module.

Once we figure out good way to have dedicated themes for module-as-application approach, we will move these files to appropriate re-organized structure.

See issue #168 under calipso "Allow themes to choose the theme".
